# API Coding Challenge &nbsp; ![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow) ![time](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%8F%B0-1h-blue)

&nbsp;
# Goals / Outcomes ‚ú®
- Database migrations
- Use of MVC structure
- JSON api responses

&nbsp;
# Pre-requisites ‚úÖ
- Install project dependencies with composer

&nbsp;
# Requirements üìñ
- The task does not require the use of authentication
- Add a listings json API to the project (in the json format)
    - Have a listing endpoint which allows you to view all the listings
    - Have a listing endpoint which allows you to view a single listing
    - Have a listing endpoint which allows you to create a listing
    - Have a listing endpoint which allows you to update an existing listing
    - Have a listing endpoint which allows you to delete a listing

&nbsp;
# Think about üí°
- How we should use pagination on the listings api endpoint
- Should data provided by the user bne validated
- How could an API endpoint be secured using authentication in future

&nbsp;
# What's Already Been Done üèÅ
- Basic laravel app

&nbsp;
